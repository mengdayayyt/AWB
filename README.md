I am currently exploring various automatic white balance algorithms, and I have already implemented the following methods: Gray World, White Patch, Perfect Reflective Surface, QCGP white balance algorithm, and image analysis-based algorithm. I am still refining and investigating the Fuzzy Rules method, Dynamic Threshold method, and Gray World based on Color Temperature.
